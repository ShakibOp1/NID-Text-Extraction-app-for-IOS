# NID-Text-Extraction-app-for-IOS
Identity verification must be secure and effective in our constantly changing digital environment. Our research, "NID Text Extraction" is at the center of this technological confluence that has resulted in unique methods for identity identification.

The second facet of our project, "NID Text Extraction," is also transformational. Long a
source of mistakes and inefficiency, manual data entering from NID documents. In this
article, we provide cutting-edge Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technique to quickly
and precisely extract text from NID documents. This development represents a big step
towards more effective document processing in identity verification since it not only
improves data correctness but also speeds up the authentication process.
